            <h1>Product Development Lifecycle</h1>
            <p>What is your <a href="/posts/product-strategy.html">product strategy</a>? The output of your product strategy should be a prioritized list of actions (initiatives) to work on next. These initiatives could be:</p>
            <div class="example-content-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>- Adding skill set metadata to job postings</li>
                    <li>- Personalizing search results</li>
                    <li>- Reduce the steps needed to apply to a job posting</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>1. Ideation</h2>
            <p>Start ideation by asking "how might we ... ?"</p>
            <div class="example-content-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>- How might we add skill set metadata to job postings?</li>
                    <li>- How might we personalize search results?</li>
                    <li>- How might we reduce the steps needed to apply to a job posting?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>There are many ways that you can do ideation. For example, setup a team meeting with your design and engineering partners, provide them with the context of the initiative you're ideating and any evidence you have (the why). Complete a whiteboarding session where each participant lists as many ideas as possible (the what). By the end of the session you should have a list of ideas to tackle within your initiative. Prioritize these ideas based on which is most likely to help your target customers achieve their goal and your business achieve its goal. These ideas will become your roadmap.</p>
            <h2>2. Validation</h2>
            <p>Now that you have a list of ideas, which are most likely to lead to success? What assumptions are you making about this idea? How can you <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">validate your assumptions</a> about this idea with minimal effort?</p> 
            <p>At this stage you'll be prototyping and meeting with your key stakeholders to validate the following:</p>
            <div class="example-content-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>- Value: does this idea add value (solve a new problem) or reduce time to existing value?</li>
                    <li>- Usability: do your target customers know how to use the idea to achieve their goal?</li>
                    <li>- Feasibility: can the idea be built?</li>
                    <li>- Viability: do you and your stakeholders agree that this idea is viable to build?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The output of each step in this validation process is whether or not we will devote resources to building a live-data prototype of this idea.</p>
            <h2>3. Development & Testing; GTM Strategy</h2>
            <p>If you decide to build a live-data prototype of this idea to test with your users then you should plan to have a GTM strategy outlined for if the idea is launched. This user test will result in whether or not there is clear evidence of value to both your users and your business. The output of this step is whether or not this idea is launched.</p>
            <h2>4. Launch</h2>
            <p>At this step you launch the idea. Continue monitoring the performance of the idea. If there is an opportunity to reduce time to existing value then consider prioritizing iterations to the idea in your roadmap.</p>
