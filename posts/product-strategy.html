                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                <p>Let's walk through building a product strategy, from surfacing problems to taking actions that solve them. There are situations where it's appropriate to start with <b>Understanding the Target Customer</b> before <b>Defining the Problem</b>, depending on the context.</p>

                <h2>Strategy Inputs:</h2>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="business-goals">1) Business Goals</h2>
                <h3>Output Metrics: the roads that lead to revenue</h3>
                <p>Your business has a goal, just like your target customer. Output metrics lead to revenue, the actions you take should impact output metrics.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Increase purchases</li>
                        <li>- Increase signups</li>
                        <li>- Reduce churn</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's focus on this business goal: <b>Increase signups</b>.</p>
                <p>Your business goal will drive your strategy. For example, if the goal is to increase signups from a new customer segment, then you will need to solve problems that create value. If you are seeking to reduce churn, then you may want to double down on existing solutions by reducing the time or effort it takes to reach value that is already provided. The answer will depend on the context of your situation.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="surface-problems">2) Surface Problems</h2>
                <p>If you walked up to someone on the street and asked, "What problem are you experiencing?" how would they respond? <i>This</i> is the problem statement we want to define. Perhaps something is inaccessible, too expensive, or takes too much time. Each product you work on helps solve a problem. What is that problem?</p>
                <p>Problem statement types and examples:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Inaccessibility: It's <b>hard to access</b> a doctor</li>
                        <li>- Cost: It's <b>too expensive</b> to travel</li>
                        <li>- Time: It <b>takes too much time</b> to cook healthy meals</li>
                        <li>- Transparency: I <b>don't know how</b> long the wait is</li>
                        <li>- Control: I <b>can't control</b> my home temperature while away</li>
                        <li>- Constraints: My phone <b>limits</b> how much media it can store</li>
                        <li>- Waste: My supply <b>expires</b> when there aren't enough customers</li>
                        <li>- Fragility: I need <b>reliable</b> internet when working remotely</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's focus on this problem statement: <b>It takes too much time to cook healthy meals</b>.</p>
                <h3>Gather Evidence: is this problem real?</h3>
                <p>Start by gathering <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html#gathering-evidence">evidence</a> to validate your assumption that this problem exists <i>before</i> moving forward.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="customer-understanding">3) Customer Understanding</h2>
                <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but instead of solving this problem for everyone, start by solving for a <i>narrow</i> customer segment.</p>
                <h3>The Small Pond Approach: who are you going to target?</h3>
                <p>Think of the ideal customer segment as a small pond containing <b>1 type</b> of fish where the fish inside often communicate with each other. The pond should be <i>big enough</i> to support your business, but <i>small enough</i> so the ripples made by your target customers reach every corner. The goal is to have the fish jumping into your boat, but you'll first need <b>word of mouth</b> about your product's value (the ripples) spreading throughout the pond.</p>
                <p>Choose a pond <i>before</i> you start fishing (the pond represents your target customer segment):</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- College students living on a budget (Generation Z aged 18-24)</li>
                        <li>- Young professionals working long hours (Generation Z aged 18-24)</li>
                        <li>- Busy parents with young children (Millennials aged 25-39)</li>
                        <li>- Fitness enthusiasts with limited time (Millennials aged 25-39)</li>
                        <li>- People with special dietary needs (Millennials aged 25-39)</li>
                        <li>- Retired individuals with health concerns (Baby Boomers aged 56-74)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's focus on this target customer: <b>Fitness enthusiasts with limited time (Millennials aged 25-39)</b>.</p>
                <p>Why should you choose a narrow customer segment? Imagine choosing 3 ponds with 3 different types of fish, fish A uses different lingo than fish B and C. The value fish A needs won't translate to fish B and C, and the value fish B needs won't translate to fish A and C. If fish A loves your product then their word of mouth (ripples) won't reach fish B or C. Or worse, you may be creating a product that has 3 features solving 3 different problems, 1 problem for fish A, 1 for fish B, and 1 for fish C, resulting in "feature shock": cramming too many features into a single confusing and expensive product.</p>
                <p>If you've caught enough fish in your target small pond then you can move on to the <i>next adjacent pond</i>.</p>
                <h3>Gather Evidence: is this problem real for your target customer?</h3>
                <p>Once you've chose your target customer (small pond) you can start to gather <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html#real-evidence">evidence</a> to validate your assumption that this problem exists <i>for them</i>.</p>
                <p>Not only is it important to know if the problem exists, but (depending on your business goal) it's going to be important to know if your target customers would receive value from the benefit your product would offer, if built. Would offering this benefit (solving this problem) be worth paying for? If yes, then how much? Is offering this benefit a must-have or nice-to-have? You can save yourself a lot of time and effort by <b><a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html#value-validation">validating these assumptions</a> now</b>.</p>
                <h4>Understand the Context of your Target Customer: what is <i>really</i> going on in their life that is pushing them to <i>want</i> to solve this problem?</h4>
                <p>Your target customers are going to be like-minded people in similar contextual situations. What is going on in their life? What situation is driving them to want to solve this problem?</p>
                <h5>Their Goal: what are they trying to accomplish?</h4>
                <p>Your target customers should have a common goal. Learn this by asking questions until you reach the goal. For example, if you're focused on the problem "It takes too much time to cook healthy meals", then ask: "Why do you want to eat healthy meals?" If you're targeting multiple ponds then you'll find that different target customers have different goals.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- College students living on a budget (Generation Z aged 18-24): I want to eat healthy meals to stay energized for my studies and workouts without spending too much money.</li>
                        <li>- Young professionals working long hours (Generation Z aged 18-24): I want to eat healthy meals to maintain my energy levels throughout the day.</li>
                        <li>- Busy parents with young children (Millennials aged 25-39): I want to eat healthy meals to set a good example for my kids and help them grow up strong.</li>
                        <li>- Fitness enthusiasts with limited time (Millennials aged 25-39): I want to eat healthy meals to optimize my performance, stay in peak condition, and align with my fitness goals.</li>
                        <li>- People with special dietary needs (Millennials aged 25-39): I want to eat healthy meals to manage my condition (food allergies, gluten sensitivity) and feel my best.</li>
                        <li>- Retired individuals with health concerns (Baby Boomers aged 56-74): I want to eat healthy meals to prevent further health issues and maintain my mobility and energy as I age.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's focus on this target customer goal: <b>I want to eat healthy meals to optimize my performance, stay in peak condition, and align with my fitness goals</b>.</p>
                <h5>Getting to the Root of <i>their</i> Problem</h4>
                <p>Next, break the problem down to its root cause. Do this by <b>asking "Why?"</b> until you reach the core issue, something <i>actionable</i>. For example: "Why does it takes too much time to cook healthy meals?"</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- ... because healthy ingredients require more preparation and cooking time compared to processed or pre-packaged foods.</li>
                        <li>- ... because I often have to buy multiple ingredients that are fresh, perishable, or specialized for my fitness goals, and prepping these takes extra time.</li>
                        <li>- ... because meal prepping and cooking nutritious meals that align with my fitness goals requires planning and organization, which can be difficult with a busy schedule.</li>
                        <li>- ... because I have to cook meals from scratch, and many healthy recipes involve complex or time-consuming steps that require careful attention.</li>
                        <li>- ... because there is a lack of time-saving options (quick-cook recipes, healthy meal kits, premade healthy options) that meet my specific dietary and fitness needs.</li>
                        <li>- ... because the healthy meal options available for quick preparation often don't taste as good or meet my expectations for nutrition, leading me to spend more time experimenting with recipes.</li>
                        <li>- ... because I don't have the right tools or appliances (slow cookers, air fryers, blenders) to efficiently prepare healthy meals within the time constraints I have.</li>
                        <li>- ... because I often feel overwhelmed by the need to track macro and micronutrient content for my fitness goals, making the process of planning and preparing meals more complex and time-consuming.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Now decide which problems that, when solved, will help your target customers achieve their goal <i>and</i> your business achieve its goal. These are the problems you should focus on solving <i>now</i>. Out of these problems, you will then need to <b>prioritize which problems to focus on first</b>. For example, we may choose to avoid solving the problem regarding not having the right tools or appliances, or the problem regarding feeling overwhelmed by the need to track macro and micronutrient content.</p>
                <p>In general, it is a good practice to <b>focus your strategy</b> on only solving a few problems at a time. <b>3 problems</b> is a good rule of thumb. Your business may refer to them as your 3 strategic pillars, or 3 initiatives.</p>
                <h5>Hiring Criteria: what does your target customer <i>need</i> in a product?</h4>
                <p>What should you account for when building a product for this user segment? Consider their <b>taste</b> in products.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I need a ready-to-use product that minimizes the time spent on cooking and cleaning, like one-pot meals, meal kits, or pre-portioned ingredients.</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that allows me to align meals with specific nutritional needs (macros: protein, carbs, fats).</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that is aligned with my fitness goals, such as those offering clean, whole-food options.</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that helps me make flavorful and satisfying meals that meet their dietary needs while still being delicious.</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that is reasonably priced, especially considering their busy lifestyles and other expenses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h5>Firing Criteria: why would your target customer <i>stop</i> using a product?</h4>
                <p>What should you avoid when building a product for this user segment?</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that is too complicated or requires too much work (requiring multiple cooking steps, special equipment, or excessive clean-up).</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that suggests food that doesn't taste good or isn't made with fresh, nutritious ingredients that isn't align with my fitness goals.</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that doesn't allow me to effectively meet my fitness and nutritional targets (providing the right macros, controlling calorie intake).</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that can't personalize meals to my exact dietary preferences or nutritional needs.</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that is too expensive and doesn't provide enough value or convenience.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Creating Personas</h3>
                <p>Personas help humanize the target customer segment by personifying the context we've learned. You're fishing in a pond of these personas. These are the fish to catch:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Gym-Goer Gabe is a fitness enthusiast with limited time that wants to eat healthy and needs their meals to help them optimize performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="competitor-understanding">4) Competitor Understanding</h2>
                <p>What products enable your target customer to eat healthy meals to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals? Your competition should include everyone that solves this problem. Where will you fit in this market? For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- MyFitnessPal enables customers to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals by suggesting recipes and showing nutrient breakdowns.</li>
                        <li>- HelloFresh enables customers to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals by suggesting recipes and having ingredients delivered to their home.</li>
                        <li>- Whole Foods enables customers to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals by offering pre-made meals.</li>
                        <li>- Favor enables customers to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals by having pre-made meal delivered to their home.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Learn the direction competitors are moving in by staying up-to-date with their product releases, release notes, updates, changelog, etc. Consider how you might <b>differentiate</b> yourself from competitors when prioritizing which strategic actions to take. Use your target customer hiring and firing criteria to guide you.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="define-hypotheses">5) Define Hypotheses</h2>
                <p>A problem well stated is a problem half solved. Define your hypothesis using the following formula:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>{X problem happens} to {target customer} {trying to achieve Y goal} because {Z}.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>The Big Bets (Hypotheses)</h3>
                <p>At this point, you should have collected enough evidence (whether that be through surveys, interviews, field studies, etc), to come up with a hypothesis. Let's assume we collected enough evidence and came up with the following hypotheses:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- It takes too much time for Gym-Goer Gabe to cook healthy meals because the process requires extensive preparation.</li>
                        <li>- It takes too much time for Gym-Goer Gabe to cook healthy meals because the process requires specialized ingredients.</li>
                        <li>- It takes too much time for Gym-Goer Gabe to cook healthy meals because the process requires nutritional planning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's focus on this hypothesis as our top priority: <b>It takes too much time to cook healthy meals because the process requires specialized ingredients</b>.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="guiding-policy">6) Guiding Policy</h2>
                <p>You should decide <i>where</i> to focus your effort <i>before</i> you decide what to build. This decision depends on whether your product has reached "Product Market Fit" (PMF) or not. For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- If you're in the Pre-PMF stage, focus efforts developing a strong counter-position against the competition.</li>
                        <li>- If you have PMF, focus efforts on building network effects, increasing switching costs, or creating scale economies.</li>
                        <li>- If you're a market leader, focus your efforts on branding, cornered resources, or process power.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Input Metrics: focusing on the "Aha!" moment, the key action signaling value was received</h3>
                <p>Often called the "North Star" metric. You will <b>increase your output metric</b> by <b>increasing how often users complete this key action</b>, this "Aha!" moment. The action represents when a user has received the value your product offers. It is the <b>action you want users to complete ASAP</b> when first using your product. Choose a value-representing action that creates network effects (<i>completing this action makes the product better for all target customers</i>) and/or switching costs (<i>completing this action makes it painful for the target customer to switch to a competitor</i>). For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Cooked recipes (recipe with dwell time >= cook time): can be used as a signal that a recipe is more likely to be cooked by target customers, and the signal can then be used to boost the visibility of these recipes to other target customers.</li>
                        <li>- Recipe saves: can make it harder for target customers to switch to a competitor because their recipe library is in your product.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>For this exercise, let's assume we've reached PMF, so our guiding policy will be: <b>Focus on building network effects by increasing cooked recipes</b>.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Strategy Outputs:</h2>
                <p>Let's summarize what we know so far:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Business Goal</b>: Increase signups.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Problem Statement</b>: It takes too much time to cook healthy meals.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Target Customer</b>: (Gym-Goer Gabe) Fitness enthusiasts with limited time (Millennials aged 25-39).</li>
                        <li>- <b>Target Customer Goal</b>: To eat healthy meals to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Hypothesis</b>: It takes too much time to cook healthy meals because the process requires specialized ingredients.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Guiding Policy</b>: Focus on building network effects by increasing cooked recipes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="paint-vision">7) Paint Vision</h2>
                <p>What does a world look like when these problems are solved? A vision paints a picture of the destination you're trying to reach so your team and customers know what direction the product is moving in.</p>
                <p>Our vision is below:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>A world where meal planning is automated, ingredient lists are simplified, and every recipe fits your fitness routine and your schedule.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Evangelize your vision. Share your vision. Communicate your vision. A tactic I use is changing my video meeting background to include my vision's text so everyone I meet with will know the future we're trying to build.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="choose-actions">8) Choose Actions</h2>
                <p>We know where we're headed, but how are we going to get there? You will want to work with your team to define which actions to take. What is built should be found at the intersection of <b>customer-centric</b> actions (solving user problems) and <b>technology-led</b> actions (using your tech stack). Each action has the goal of impacting <b>input metrics</b> that move <b>output metrics</b>. Additionally, actions should factor in your user segments' <b>hiring</b> and <b>firing criteria</b> and, if possible, <b>differentiate</b> your product from competitors.</p>
                <h3>Use Inflections: what "new thing" has been introduced to the world?</h3>
                <p>What "new thing" was introduced? How can that "new thing" empower your product? Inflections come from technological advances, regulatory changes, or belief shifts. Inflections are <i>waves of change</i> in an industry or population, use them to your advantage! For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Technology: LLMs, smartphones, cloud computing</li>
                        <li>- Regulation: telemedicine laws from covid, GDPR, cannabis legalization</li>
                        <li>- Belief: work from home adoption, climate change awareness, crypotcurrency as a financial asset</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Define Use Cases: how will your target customer use your product to achieve their goal?</h3>
                <p>Consider the use cases of your product. How will your target customer use your product to achieve their goal? For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Gym-Goer Gabes can discover new, simple recipes limited to the simplest ingredients in their kitchen on our product to eat healthy meals to optimize their performance, stay in peak condition, and align with their fitness goals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Brainstorm Ideas: how might we solve these problems?</h3>
                <p>Work with your team to surface ideas for what to build next. Start by asking this question: "Using the information we know, <i>how might we {solve this problem}</i>?"</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- How might we reduce the time it takes for Gym-Goer Gabes to cook healthy meals without requiring specialized ingredients?</li>
                        <li>- <b>[Bonus]</b> How might we reduce the time it takes in a <i>never-before-seen</i> way?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>List out all of the brainstorm ideas for the problem. For example, to reduce the time it takes for Gym-Goer Gabes to cook healthy meals without requiring specialized ingredients we can build:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>[What's In My Kitchen? Recipe Generator]</b> If we let users input common ingredients they have available to get fast, fitness-aligned recipes instantly then we can increase cooked recipes.</li>
                        <li>- <b>[Quick & Easy Recipe Tagging]</b> If we tag and suggest recipes that use less than 5 common ingredients with total preparation and cook time less than 20 minutes then we can increase cooked recipes.</li>
                        <li>- <b>[Weekly Meal Prep Suggestions]</b> If we suggest a rotating list of recipes that can be prepped in bulk and meet gym-goer macros then we can increase cooked recipes.</li>
                        <li>- <b>[Nutritionist Chatbot for Instant Meal Advice]</b> If we let users ask: "I've got eggs, oats, and spinach. What can I make in 10 mins for a post-workout meal?" to get macro-aligned meals instantly then we can increase cooked recipes.</li>
                        <li>- <b>[AI-Powered Recipe Shrinker]</b> If we automatically simplify complex recipes by reducing steps, combining or substituting ingredients, and suggesting easier cooking methods then we can increase cooked recipes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Validate Ideas: can we build this?</h3>
                <p>Validate your <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">assumptions</a> on if the proposed idea is feasible and viable.</p>
                <h3>Prioritize Ideas: which ideas are most impactful?</h3>
                <p>Prioritization is a balance of reach, impact, and effort:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Reach: how many est. users will use this feature?</li>
                        <li>- Impact: is this a must-have feature, an improvement, or a nice-to-have feature?</li>
                        <li>- Effort: how much est. time will this take to build? Days, weeks, months?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h4>Prioritize Counter-Positioning: playing offense</h4>
                <p>How can your ideas position yourself against the competition? Emphasize hiring criteria, firing criteria, and competitive differentiation in your projects. Consider how you might position your product:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>For Gym-Goer Gabes who are dissatisfied with complex meal tracking apps, our product is a simple meal planning subscription suggesting recipes tailored to your fitness goals. Unlike MyFitnessPal, we have developed a product that uses ingredients available in your home to suggest easy-to-make meals that help you reach your fitness goals.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="execution">9) Execution</h2>
                <p>Gather requirements, provide context, get commitments, assemble resources, and <b>build valuable products</b> with your team.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="go-to-market">10) Go-to-Market</h2>
                <p>How are you going to bring your product to market? How will your target customers learn about the benefit you're offering them? As mentioned when discussing the small pond approach to targeting customer segments: <b>The goal is to have the fish jumping into your boat</b>, but you'll first need <b>word of mouth</b> about your product's value (the ripples) spreading throughout the pond. Your go-to-market strategy should be aimed at increasing word of mouth (increasing the ripples within your target pond) to create <b>real virality</b>. How might you approach this?</p>
                <h3>System Awareness: where would you find your target customers?</h3>
                <p>Consider what system you might use to find your target customers and expose them to your product, for example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Online systems: forums, communities, channels, social media, etc.</li>
                        <li>- Offline systems: offices, conferences, trade shows, storefronts, campuses, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Novelty <i>within</i> that System: how can you catch the attention of your target customers?</h3>
                <p>What novelty can you add within the system that is used by your target customers to catch their attention? For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- If the system is a gym then you could use reverse graffiti to create an advertisement on the sidewalk leading up to the front door.</li>
                        <li>- If the system is a social media platform then you could like 10-year old posts made by your target customers.</li>
                        <li>- If the system is the Super Bowl then you could create a commercial that is just a QR code bouncing around the screen.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Even better if the novelty has <i>some</i> <b>disagreeableness</b> to really start a buzz. For example, if you test an ad and find that 50% of the viewers <i>hate</i> that ad, then you may be on your way to generating a go-to-market strategy that will really get people talking. For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- If the system is a gym then you could use reverse graffiti to create an advertisement on the sidewalk leading up to the front door that says "<i>2025 Recession Special: 10% off your first month with code <u>ELON</u></i>".</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>The best novelty ideas are <i>never-before-seen</i>.</p>
                <h3>Repeat Visibility <i>within</i> that System: how can you <i>convince</i> your target customers to try your product?</h3>
                <p>Your target customers need to be exposed to your marketing message <b>at least 3+ times</b> to be convinced to try your product.</p>
                <h3>Credibility: how can you gain credibility within your target customers?</h3>
                <p>Most importantly, if your target customers don't find you to be credible then your go-to-market strategy won't catch on. Find ways to gain credibility within your target customers, for example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Have a product advocate that meets with and talks with your target customers.</li>
                        <li>- Publish content (blogs, podcasts, etc.) that shows your target customers your company is an expert in this subject.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Getting your 1st target customers</h3>
                <p>If you're finding it hard to get your target customers then consider <b>doing things that don't scale</b> to acquire them. Give your target customers the push they need to get started. If you accurately validated the value of your product earlier in this process then you may need to do some extra work to find that 1st fish who will create the first ripple in your pond.</p>
