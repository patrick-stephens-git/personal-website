                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>Define your product strategy by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- What is your business trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- Who are your target customers and what are they trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- What problems do your target customers have that make it hard for them to achieve their goal and for your business to achieve its goal?</li>
                            <li>- What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</li>
                            <li>- Where should you focus your effort?</li>
                            <li>- Which actions should you take next?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>1. What is your business trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Your business goals are the metrics your business is trying to impact:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Increase sign ups</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>2. Who are your target customers and what are they trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Who are the customers that would be very disappointed if they could no longer use your product? These are the customers that would consider your product as a "must-have" solution to their problem:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- 25-35 year old (mid-career) Jobseeker in the Tech Industry</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>What goal does your target customer have? This is sometimes referred to as their job to be done:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Get a job</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    <p>How would your target customer achieve their goal using your product? What use cases exist?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Search for a specific job title</li>
                            <li>- Search for a specific company</li>
                            <li>- Search for a specific skill set</li>
                            <li>- Search for remote positions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Which core action represents when your target customer has achieved their goal using your product (the “aha!” moment)? Increasing the frequency of this core action should correlate to positively impacting your business goals. This should be your product goal:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- When a job application is submitted</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>3. What problems do your target customers have that make it hard for them to achieve their goal? Which of those problems make it hard for your business to achieve its goal?</h2>
                    <p>Deeply understand the problems that your target customers have to form an insight and a hypothesis. Look into the future.</p>
                    <p>Start with a problem statement:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Users are not applying to jobs when they search using skill set queries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Have an insight by asking yourself "why does the world have to be this way?" and then "what if ... ?":</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Why are users not applying to jobs when they search using skill set queries? Because the job postings returned are not relevant.</li>
                            <li>2. Why are the job postings returned not relevant for skill set queries? Because our job postings do not contain skill set metadata.</li>
                            <li>3. Why do our job postings not contain skill set metadata? Because companies that upload job postings to our site do not provide us with skill set metadata.</li>
                            <li>4. What if we could add skill set metadata to our job postings without having to rely on the business that provides it?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, form your hypothesis based on your insight:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If we add skill set metadata to our job postings then we can increase applies to job postings for skill set queries because we will be able to retrieve relevant job postings by matching the query to the skill set field of each job posting</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Be sure to maintain a list of problems that surface over time.</p>
                    <h2>4. Which market offerings do your target customers use to achieve their goal?</h2>
                    <p>What would your target customers compare your product to?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Indeed</li>
                            <li>- LinkedIn</li>
                            <li>- Glassdoor</li>
                            <li>- ZipRecruiter</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave the market offering they currently use? Your target customers might leave the market offering they use today if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave your product for a different market offering? Your target customers might leave your product if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <h2>5. Where should you focus your effort?</h2>
                    <p>What stage of Product Market Fit (PMF) is your product in?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If pre-PMF then focus on exploiting your counter-position</li>
                            <li>- If post-PMF then focus on exploiting network effects, switching costs, or scale economies</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this example let's assume we are post-PMF. We will want to focus our effort on the network effects of job applications being submitted (this is also our "aha!" moment). A job application being submitted can be used as a signal that this job posting is high quality, which then improves the quality of our search results for all future users.</p>
                    <h2>6. Which actions should you take next? (Initiatives)</h2>
                    <p>By now you know your business goals and the goals of your target customers. You understand the market and how you can acquire customers that use other market offerings to achieve their goals. You have a list of problems you could solve and hypotheses to solve them. And you know where to focus your effort. What actions are you going to take that will help your target customers achieve their goal while helping your business achieve its goal?</p>
                    <p>Actions are not roadmap items. Actions represent initiatives you're going to work on. Multiple roadmap items can fall under a single initiative. Your actions will likely fall within one of the categories below:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Add new value by building a way for your target customers to achieve their goal using your product; increase user acquisition</li>
                            <li>- Reduce time to established value by removing friction in the user task flow leading up to the core action representing the “aha!” moment (double down on your existing value); increase user retention</li>
                            <li>- Scale established value if justified by ROI; increase user acquisition and retention</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Now that you have a list of actions to work on next it's time to start the <a href="/posts/product-development-lifecycle.html">product development lifecycle</a>.</p>
