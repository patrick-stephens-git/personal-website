                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>How would I approach product strategy? I'll refine this post over time...</p>
                    <h2>1) Target Customer</h2>
                    <p>Start by identifying the right customer to target...</p>
                    <h3>What is your target customer trying to achieve?</h3>
                    <p>The way I like to approach this is by thinking of their job-to-be-done (JTBD)...</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Functional Jobs: </li>
                            <li>- Emotional Jobs: </li>
                            <li>- Social Jobs: </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Consider the context of your target customer when trying to accomplish this goal... if the JTBD is "eat dinner" then one context will lead to pizza while another will lead to steak...</p>
                    <h3>Which group does your target customer fall into?</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the group you may make different decisions in your strategy...</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Innovators: </li>
                            <li>- Early Adopters: </li>
                            <li>- Early Majority: </li>
                            <li>- Late Majority: </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Who is your target customer?</h3>
                    <p>Considering what you've learned above... who is your target customer? Sometimes referred to as a persona... This persona should be specific.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Individual Contributors: </li>
                            <li>- Department Managers: </li>
                            <li>- Enterprise Executives: </li>
                            <li>- SMB Owners: </li>
                            <li>- Consumers: </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Which problems does your target customer run into when attempting to achieve their goal?</h3>
                    <p>Solving problems == creating value. When writing out problem statements it's important to EXCLUDE solutions, internal jargon (e.g: CTR, optimize), and ambitions (e.g: "I want to be the very best like no one ever was!").</p>
                    <h4>How to surface problems:</h4>
                    <p>There are many ways to surface problems... If you're creating a new product then think about the journey your target customer takes to achieve their goal... If you're working with an existing product then while also thinking about the journey your target customer takes to achieve their goal using your product you should also listen to user feedback, read user reviews, watch users interact with your product, etc...</p>
                    <h4>Include evidence:</h4>
                    <p>Use <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">evidence</a> to validate your assumptions regarding whether or not a problem is real.</p>
                    <h3>What are the use cases of your product?</h3>
                    <p>What will your target customer do with your product to solve their problem?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        Use this template to help identify a use case: <i>{persona} {does something; aka "the use case"} {on your product} in order to {achieve their goal; aka "the JTBD"}</i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>What is the taste of your target customers?</h3>
                    <p>You'll want to match their taste as you build your product.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>2) Competitive Arena</h2>
                    <h3>Who does your target customer compare you to?</h3>
                    <p>Gather a list of market substitutes for your product. If the JTBD is "get from Point A to Point B" and the product you offer is a car then you are competiting against not only cars, but also taxis, bikes, scooters, trains, etc.</p>
                    <h3>What problems make your target customers uncomfortable with the market substitute that they currently use?</h3>
                    <p>Learn about how your target customers accomplish their JTBD using market substitutes... Learn about the problems they have with their current product preference...</p>
                    <h4>Which of these problems would trigger your target customers to consider trying a new product?</h4>
                    <p>Even though these problems exist for your target customers your product must be significantly better if you want them to switch to you.</p>
                    
                    

                    <h2>3) Business Goal</h2>
                    <h3>What is your company trying to achieve?</h3>
                    <p>This is usually something along the lines of increasing acquisition or reducing churn... All roads lead to revenue...</p>
                    <h3>What is the Aha! moment that leads to this goal being achieved?</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes referred to as the "North Star" metric... When a user completes this action on your product then your business has a high likelihood of achieving its goal... This action usually represents that the user has received a good taste of what your product has to offer (and is likely to stick around)...</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>4) Identify 3-5 Problems to Solve</h2>
                    <h3>Use the intersection between helping your target customer achieve their goal & helping your business achieve its goal</h3>
                    <p>Now that you have an understanding of the problems your target customer is experiencing, which of those problems would get them to try a new product, and which of those problems (if solved) would positively impact your business goal, it's time to define which of the top 3-5 problems we can solve now within the timeline of your strategy (your strategy will usually change every 6-18 months)...</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>5) Vision</h2>
                    <h3>What does the world look like when these problems are solved?</h3>
                    <p>Before jumping into what route you're going to take you should paint a picture of what destination you're going to reach...</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- a future where customers can find anything they want to buy online.</li>
                            <li>- a future where cities have no parking lots.</li>

                            <li>- IF Post-PMF THEN focus on network effects, switching costs, or scale economies.</li>
                            <li>- IF Extreme-PMF THEN focus on branding, cornered resources, or process power.</li>

                    <h2>7) Actions</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes referred to as initiatives...</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES <b>NOT</b> already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that solve this problem for your target customer using your product.</li>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that reduce the time it takes for your target customer to solve this problem using your product.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Use the intersection between customer-centric actions & technology-led actions</h3>
                    <p>What are the problems that you are aiming to solve for your target customer? How can you use your tech stack to solve those problems? Are there any limitations with your current tech stack?</p>
                    <h4>What inflection is happening now?</h4>
                    <p>What "new thing" has been introduced to the world? How can that "new thing" empower your product? What conditions need to be met in order for that empowerment to remain? Inflections can come from technological advances, regulatory changes, or shifts in beliefs by your target customers...</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>- Regulation Inflections: Shelter-in-place (covid)</li>
                            <li>- Belief Inflections: Increasing trust in online reviews</li>

                    <p>Don't be better than the competition, be fundamentally different... What do people believe today that is not true (also known as a "false first principle")? How can you validate the assumption that this "false first principle" is not the only truth? </p>
