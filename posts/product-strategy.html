                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>How would I approach product strategy?</p>
                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>0) Define the Core Problem</h2>
                    <p>If you were to walk up to someone on the street and ask them which problem they were having, what would they say to you? <i>This</i> is the type of problem statement we want to define. Perhaps something is inaccessible, too expensive, or it takes too much time or too many steps to complete a task. Every product you work on is going to help somebody solve some problem in order to achieve some goal. How would you write out that problem?</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples of core problem statements you might hear if you're focused on acquiring new users:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It's hard for me to access a doctor</li>
                            <li>- I can't eat a healthy meal each day</li>
                            <li>- I'm unable to remember all of my passwords</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Here are some core problem statements you might hear if you're focused on optimizing for existing users:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It takes too long to complete my task</li>
                            <li>- I don't understand how to use this</li>
                            <li>- I haven't had a reason to return</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Sub Problems</h3>
                    <p>Let's focus on a single core problem statement: "I can't eat a healthy meal each day." While this may be what someone on the street tells you when you ask them what problem they're having, there are usually underlying reasons that can you give you more context about the <i>true</i> problems they're experiencing. You can get a better understanding of the underlying problems by asking "Why?"</p>
                    <p>For example if you asked: "Why can't you eat a healthy meal each day?" You might get the following answers:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I think cooking takes too long</li>
                            <li>- I don't know how to cook</li>
                            <li>- I'm too busy most evenings to cook</li>
                            <li>- I'm too tired at the end of the day to cook</li>
                            <li>- I don't enjoy cooking</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>A common technique for learning the underlying problems someone may be facing that leads to their core problem statement is to continue asking "Why?" until you get to the root cause.</p>
                    <h3>Gather Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Be sure to gather <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">evidence</a> to validate your assumptions regarding whether or not a problem is real. Your strategy starts with a deep understanding of which problems you want to (and which you can) solve. Once you've identified the problem you want to solve, you can then dive into understanding who is affected by it.</p>
                    




                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>1) Define the Target Customer</h2>
                    <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but you are going to want to choose a <i>narrow</i> user segment to target. I think of this as a "small pond" approach: you will want to focus on a small pond, acquiring the smaller fish (early market) within that pond so that you can eventually work your way up to catching its bigger fish (mainstream market). Your smaller fish are going to be less risk averse, seeking out new solutions and strategic leaps forward to accomplish their goals. Your bigger fish are going to be more risk averse, looking for incremental improvements towards accomplising their goals; they'll learn about you through word of mouth. Let's work our way to a narrow customer segment:</p>
                    <h3>Define the Type of Target Customer</h3>
                    <p>Understand what type of customer you're targeting and selling to. You're going to need to spend a lot of time with them, whether you like it or not. These are the fish in the pond that will spread the word about your product amongst themselves (that is, if you can solve their problem) so that eventually the big fish in the pond start to become aware of what you have to offer.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Consumers (Hobbyists, Students): make low cost purchase decisions for their specific use cases.</li>
                            <li>- Individual Contributors (Engineers, Designers): doesn't make purchase decisions, but they'll be able to get you a seat at the purchasing table for specific use cases.</li>
                            <li>- Department Managers: make medium cost purchase decisions for specific use cases that can be adobted within their organization.</li>
                            <li>- Enterprise Executives: make large cost purchase decisions for use cases that can be adopted broadly throughout their company.</li>
                            <li>- SMB Owners: make low cost purchase decisions for use cases that return significant value.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Define the Goal of the Target Customer</h3>
                    <p>At this point you have an understanding of the problem you want to solve, which will coincide with the goal your target customer is trying to achieve:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the problem is "I can't eat a healthy meal each day" then the goal is likely "I want to eat a healthy meal each day"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Context of the Target Customer</h3>
                    <p>You understand what type of customer you're targeting and what goal your customer has, but why does your customer want to achieve this goal? What is going on in their life? What situation are they in that drives them to want to do this? Here are some examples for why a user may want to achieve the goal of eating a health meal each day:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Receiving a health diagnosis</li>
                            <li>- Starting a workout routine</li>
                            <li>- Aligning with sustainability goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Create a Persona</h3>
                    <p>Now that we have a clearer picture of who we're targeting, let's create a persona. Here is an example of a simple persona for our target customers' goal and context: <i>Time-Crunched Tina (age: 25-34) is a consumer who is starting a new workout routine that requires a healthy diet, but she can't eat healthy meals each day.</i></p>


                    
                    
                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>2) Define the Competitive Arena</h2>
                    <h3>Define Market Substitutes</h3>
                    <p>If your target user has a goal of eating a healthy meal each day then how can they achieve their goal in the market right now? Your competition isn't who is doing <i>what you're doing</i>, it's who offers a solution to your target users' problem. Here are some examples of market substitutes for Time-Crunched Tina:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Whole Foods: pick up a pre-made meal</li>
                                <li>- Favor: have a pre-made meal delivered</li>
                                <li>- HelloFresh: have ingredients delivered with simple recipes</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    <h3>Define the Target Customer Firing Criteria</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then what problems would trigger them to switch from a market substitute to a new product? By understanding the context of your target customers' situation you can also understand their firing criteria, for example, if your target customer is on a budget then they may not be willing to pay for pre-made meals.</p>
                    <h3>Define the Target Customer Hiring Criteria</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then how could your product be substantially better than the market substitute? By understanding the context of your target customers' situation you can also understand their hiring criteria, for example, if your target customer visits the grocery store each week (to buy non-food items) then they may be willing to use a service that recommends which ingredients to buy while they're at the store.</p>

                    
                    

                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>3) Business Goal</h2>
                    <h3>Define the Output Metrics</h3>
                    <p>Similar to how your target customer has a problem they want to solve, your business has a problem that they want to solve too. What is your business goal? Is it to increase signups or to reduce churn? Ultimately, all roads lead to revenue. The business goals are going to be the output metrics that your strategy is going to be focused on pushing.</p>
                    
                    


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>4) Identify 3-5 Problems to Solve</h2>
                    <p>By now you have an understanding of the problems your target customer is experiencing and the goals of your business. Out of all the problems you've listed that your target customer is experiencing, which of those problems make it hard for your business to achieve its goal? These are the problems you'll want to solve.</p>
                    <p>Out of the problems we discovered previously, let's focus on these problems:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I think cooking takes too long</li>
                            <li>- I don't know how to cook</li>
                            <li>- I'm too busy most evenings to cook</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>5) Vision</h2>
                    <p>What does the world look like after these these problems are solved? Create a product vision by painting a picture of what destination you're going to reach.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- A future where preparing and enjoying a healthy meal will feel as effortless and natural as making a cup of coffee.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>



                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>6) Focus</h2>
                    <p>Now that we know where we're headed, how are we going to get there? How are we going to win? How are you going to beat the competition?</p>
                    <h3>What stage of Product Market Fit is your product in?</h3>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- IF Pre-PMF THEN focus on counter-positioning.</li>
                            <li>- IF Post-PMF THEN focus on network effects, switching costs, or scale economies.</li>
                            <li>- IF Extreme-PMF THEN focus on branding, cornered resources, or process power.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Define the Aha! Moment (Input Metrics)</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes referred to as the "North Star" metric. This is the "core action" that, when increased, will correlates with increasing your business's output metrics. This core action being completed by a user usually represents that the user has received a "good taste" of the value that your product has to offer, and therefore is likely to stick around.</p>
                    <p>When you're brainstorming for what your Aha! moment is, be aware that if a user completes this action then it <i>should</i> result in increased switching costs and network effects.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES <b>NOT</b> already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that solve this problem for your target customer using your product.</li>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that reduce the time it takes for your target customer to solve this problem using your product.</li>

                    <p>What are the problems that you are aiming to solve for your target customer? How can you use your tech stack to solve those problems? Are there any limitations with your current tech stack?</p>
                    <h4>What inflection is happening now?</h4>
                    <p>What "new thing" has been introduced to the world? How can that "new thing" empower your product? What conditions need to be met in order for that empowerment to remain? Inflections can come from technological advances, regulatory changes, or shifts in beliefs by your target customers...</p>

                        <ul>
