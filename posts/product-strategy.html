                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>How would I approach product strategy?</p>
                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>0) Define the Problem</h2>
                    <p>If you were to walk up to someone on the street and ask them which problem they were having, what would they say to you? <i>This</i> is the type of problem statement we want to define. Perhaps something is inaccessible, too expensive, or it takes too much time or too many steps to complete a task. Every product you work on is going to help somebody solve some problem in order to achieve some goal. How would you write out that problem?</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples of problem statements you might hear if you're focused on acquiring new users:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It's hard for me to access a doctor</li>
                            <li>- I don't have the time to spend hours preparing and cooking a healthy meal each day</li>
                            <li>- I'm unable to remember all of my passwords</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Here are some problem statements you might hear if you're focused on optimizing for existing users:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It takes too long to complete my task</li>
                            <li>- I don't understand how to use this</li>
                            <li>- I haven't had a reason to return</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Be sure to gather <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">evidence</a> to validate your assumptions regarding whether or not a problem is real. Your strategy starts with a deep understanding of which problems you want to (and which you can) solve. Once you've identified a problem you want to solve, you can then dive into understanding who is affected by it.</p>
                    




                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>1) Define the Target Customer</h2>
                    <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but you are going to want to choose a <i>narrow</i> user segment to target. I think of this as a "small pond" approach: you will want to focus on a small pond, acquiring the smaller fish (early market) within that pond so that you can eventually work your way up to catching its bigger fish (mainstream market). Your smaller fish are going to be less risk averse, seeking out new solutions and strategic leaps forward to accomplish their goals. Your bigger fish are going to be more risk averse, looking for incremental improvements towards accomplising their goals; they'll learn about you through word of mouth. Let's work our way to a narrow customer segment:</p>
                    <h3>Define the Goal of the Target Customer</h3>
                    <p>At this point you have an understanding of the problem you want to solve, which will coincide with the goal your target customer is trying to achieve:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the problem is "I don't have the time to spend hours preparing and cooking a healthy meal each day" then the goal is likely "I want to eat a healthy meal each day"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Define the Type of Target Customer</h3>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Consumers (Hobbyists, College Students)</li>
                            <li>- Individual Contributors (Engineers, Designers)</li>
                            <li>- Department Managers</li>
                            <li>- Enterprise Executives</li>
                            <li>- SMB Owners (Real Estate Agents, Lawyers)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Context of the Target Customer</h3>
                    <p>Why does your customer want to achieve this goal? What is going on in their life? What situation are they in that drives them to want to do this? Here are some examples for why a user may want to achieve the goal of eating a health meal each day:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Receiving a health diagnosis</li>
                            <li>- Starting a workout routine</li>
                            <li>- Aligning with sustainability goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Define the Persona</h3>
                    <p>Now that we've defined our target customer, let's clearly define our target customer aka the "persona". Here is an example of a simple persona for our target user goal and problem: <i>Time-Crunched Tina is a manager (age: 25-34) who is starting a new workout routine that requires a healthy diet, but she doesn't have enough time in her day to prepare and cook healthy meals.</i></p>


                    
                    
                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>2) Define the Competitive Arena</h2>
                    <h3>Define Market Substitutes</h3>
                    <p>If your target user has a goal of eating a healthy meal each day then how can they achieve their goal in the market right now? Your competition isn't who is doing <i>what you're doing</i>, it's who offers a solution to your target users' problem. Here are some examples of market substitutes for Time-Crunched Tina:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Whole Foods: pick up a pre-made meal</li>
                                <li>- Favor: have a pre-made meal delivered</li>
                                <li>- HelloFresh: have ingredients delivered with simple recipes</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    <h3>Define the Target Customer Firing Criteria</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then what problems would trigger them to switch from a market substitute to a new product? Talk to your target customers to learn their firing criteria.</p>
                    <h3>Define the Target Customer Hiring Criteria</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then how could your product be substantially better than the market substitute? Talk to your target customers to learn their hiring criteria.</p>
                    <h3>Positioning</h3>
                    <p>No one likes talking to a salesman, but everyone likes going shopping. Make it easy for your target customers to choose your product over a market substitute.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        Use this template to help write your positioning statement: <i>For {personas} who are dissatisfied with {market substitute}, our product is a {product category} that {solves X problem}. Unlike {market substitute}, we have assembled {list of product features for specific use cases}.</i>
                    </div>

                    
                    

                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>3) Business Goal</h2>
                    <h3>What is your company trying to achieve?</h3>
                    <p>This is usually something along the lines of increasing acquisition or reducing churn... All roads lead to revenue...</p>
                    <h3>What is the Aha! moment that leads to this goal being achieved?</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes referred to as the "North Star" metric... When a user completes this action on your product then your business has a high likelihood of achieving its goal... This action usually represents that the user has received a good taste of what your product has to offer (and is likely to stick around)...</p>

                    <h2>4) Identify 3-5 Problems to Solve</h2>
                    <h3>Use the intersection between helping your target customer achieve their goal & helping your business achieve its goal</h3>
                    <p>Now that you have an understanding of the problems your target customer is experiencing, which of those problems would get them to try a new product, and which of those problems (if solved) would positively impact your business goal, it's time to define which of the top 3-5 problems we can solve now within the timeline of your strategy (your strategy will usually change every 6-18 months)...</p>

                    <h3>What does the world look like when these problems are solved?</h3>
                    <p>Before jumping into what route you're going to take you should paint a picture of what destination you're going to reach...</p>

                    <p>Sometimes referred to as initiatives...</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES <b>NOT</b> already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that solve this problem for your target customer using your product.</li>
                            <li>- IF your product DOES already solve the problem THEN you can take actions that reduce the time it takes for your target customer to solve this problem using your product.</li>

                    <p>What "new thing" has been introduced to the world? How can that "new thing" empower your product? What conditions need to be met in order for that empowerment to remain?
