                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                <p>Let's walk through building a product strategy, from surfacing problems to taking actions that solve them. There are situations where it's appropriate to start with <b>Understanding the Target Customer</b> before <b>Defining the Problem</b>, depending on the context.</p>

                <h2>Strategy Inputs:</h2>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="define-the-problem">1) Define the Problem</h2>
                <p>If you walked up to someone on the street and asked, “What problem are you experiencing?” how would they respond? <i>This</i> is the problem statement we want to define. Perhaps something is inaccessible, too expensive, or takes too much time. Each product you work on helps solve a problem. What is that problem?</p>
                <p>Problem statement examples:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- It's hard for me to access a doctor</li>
                        <li>- I can't eat a healthy meal each day</li>
                        <li>- I'm unable to remember all of my passwords</li>
                        <li>- It takes too long to complete my task</li>
                        <li>- I don't understand how to use this feature</li>
                        <li>- I can't find what I'm looking for</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Getting to the Root Problem: what's <i>really</i> going on here?</h3>
                <p>Next, break the problem down to its root cause, something <i>actionable</i>. Do this by asking “Why?” until you reach the core issue. For example: "Why can't you eat a healthy meal each day?"</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I don't know how to cook → Why? I don't have access to beginner-friendly meals</li>
                        <li>- I think cooking takes too long → Why? I don't know any quick meals to make</li>
                        <li>- I don't know which meals to cook → Why? I don't know which meals align with my goals</li>
                        <li>- I think healthy ingredients are expensive → Why? I don't know which ingredients are affordable</li>
                        <li>- I don't enjoy the taste of healthy food → Why? I don't know which meals align with my taste</li>
                        <li>- I'm not motivated to cook → Why? I don't see immediate benefits from eating healthy</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Gather Evidence: is this problem real?</h3>
                <p>Gather <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">evidence</a> to validate your assumptions. Strategy begins with a deep understanding of the problems your customers experience.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="understand-the-target-customer">2) Understand the Target Customer: who has this problem <i>and</i> wants a solution?</h2>
                <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but instead of solving this problem for everyone, start by solving for a <i>narrow</i> user segment. Think of this user segment as a pond where the fish communicate with each other. The pond should be big enough for business impact, but small enough so ripples can reach every corner. Your goal is to have fish jumping into your boat as word of mouth spreads through the pond.</p>
                <h3>Understand the Context of the Target Customer Situation: what's <i>really</i> going on in their life?</h3>
                <p>The user segment should include like-minded people in similar contextual situations. What is going on in their life? What situation is driving them to want to solve this problem?</p>
                <h4>Their Goal: what are they trying to do?</h4>
                <p>The user segment should focus on customers with a common goal. Learn this by asking questions until you reach the goal. For example: "Why do you want to eat a healthy meal each day?"</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I want to live a healthier lifestyle → Why? I've received a health diagnosis and I want to lower my cholesterol.</li>
                        <li>- I want to live a healthier lifestyle → Why? I'm starting a new workout routine and I want to build muscle.</li>
                        <li>- I want to live a healthier lifestyle → Why? I'm uncomfortable with my appearance and I want to lose weight.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Let's focus on the user segment whose goal is to build muscle. This is our pond.</p>
                <h4>Their Hiring Criteria: what do they <i>need</i> in a product?</h4>
                <p>What should you account for when building a product for this user segment?</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I need a product that helps me prepare meals</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that simplifies cooking</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that shows the nutrient breakdown of my meal</li>
                        <li>- I need a product that suggests recipes tailored to my goals</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h4>Their Firing Criteria: why would they stop using a product?</h4>
                <p>What should you avoid when building a product for this user segment?</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that makes cooking a chore</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that is complex</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that is high effort</li>
                        <li>- I don't want a product that suggests meals misaligned with my goals</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Creating Personas</h3>
                <p>Personas help humanize the target user segment by personifying the context we've learned. You're fishing in a pond of these personas. These are the fish to catch:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Gym-Goer Gabe is starting a workout routine and needs a simple way to find and prepare healthy meals tailored to his fitness goal of building muscle.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="identify-competitors">3) Identify Competitors: who solves this problem?</h2>
                <p>What products enable your target customer to eat healthy to build muscle? Your competition includes everyone that solves this problem. Where do you fit in this market? For example:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- MyFitnessPal enables customers to eat healthy to build muscle by suggesting recipes and showing nutrient breakdowns</li>
                            <li>- HelloFresh enables customers to eat healthy to build muscle by suggesting recipes and having ingredients delivered to their home</li>
                            <li>- Whole Foods enables customers to eat healthy to build muscle by offering pre-made meals</li>
                            <li>- Favor enables customers to eat healthy to build muscle by having pre-made meal delivered to their home</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                <p>Learn the direction competitors are moving in by staying up-to-date with release notes. Consider how you might differentiate yourself from competitors when prioritizing strategic actions to take. Use hiring and firing criteria as guiding policies.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="recognize-the-business-goal">4) Recognize the Business Goal: what are you trying to do?</h2>
                <h3>Output Metrics: the roads that lead to revenue</h3>
                <p>Your business has a goal, just like your user segment. Output metrics lead to revenue, the actions you take should impact output metrics.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Increase trial signups</li>
                        <li>- Increase bill-throughs</li>
                        <li>- Reduce account cancellations</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Input Metrics: focusing on the "Aha!" moment, the key action signaling value was received</h3>
                <p>Often called the “North Star” metric. This key action, when moved, will also move your output metrics. The action represents when a user receives product value. It is the action you want users to take when first using your product. Choose a value representing action that creates network effects and/or switching costs.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Recipe dwell time >= est. cook time</li>
                        <li>- Recipe saves</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="set-the-guiding-policy">5) Set the Guiding Policy: where should you focus your effort?</h2>
                <p>You need to decide where to focus your effort before you decide what to build. This decision depends on whether your product has “Product Market Fit” (PMF) or not.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- If you're in the Pre-PMF stage, focus efforts developing a strong counter-position against the competition.</li>
                        <li>- If you have PMF, focus efforts on building network effects, increasing switching costs, or creating scale economies.</li>
                        <li>- If you're a market leader, focus your efforts on branding, cornered resources, or process power.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Strategy Outputs:</h2>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="choose-the-root-problems-to-solve-now">6) Choose the Root Problems to Solve <i>Now</i></h2>
                <p>By now you understand your target user segment, context about their situation, their goal to achieve and the problems in their way, the competitive solutions that solve those problems, the goal of your business, and where to focus your effort. Now decide which problems that, when solved, will help users achieve their goal <i>and</i> the business achieve its goal.</p>
                <p>From the surfaced problems, let's focus on:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- I don't have access to beginner-friendly meals</li>
                        <li>- I don't know any quick meals to make</li>
                        <li>- I don't know which meals align with my goals</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Keep focus by solving a few problems at a time.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="paint-your-vision">7) Paint your Vision</h2>
                <p>What does the world look like after solving these problems? A vision paints a picture of the destination you're trying to reach so your team and customers know what direction the product is moving in.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>A future where preparing the healthy meal you need will feel as effortless as making a cup of coffee.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Evangelize your vision. Share your vision. Communicate your vision. A tactic I use is changing my video meeting background to include my vision's text so everyone I meet with will know it.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2 id="determine-your-actions">8) Determine your Actions: what are we going to build <i>now</i>?</h2>
                <p>We know where we're headed, but how are we going to get there? You will want to work with your team to define which actions to take (sometimes called “initiatives”). What is built should be found at the intersection of <b>customer-centric</b> actions (solving user problems) and <b>technology-led</b> actions (using your tech stack). Each action should impact <b>input metrics</b> that move <b>output metrics</b>. Additionally, actions should factor in your user segments' <b>hiring</b> and <b>firing criteria</b> and, if possible, <b>differentiate</b> your product from competitors.</p>
                <h3>Inflections: what new thing has been introduced?</h3>
                <p>What "new thing" was introduced? How can that “new thing” empower your product? Inflections come from technological advances, regulatory changes, or belief shifts. Inflections are waves of change in an industry or population. For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Technology: LLMs, smartphones, cloud computing</li>
                        <li>- Regulation: telemedicine laws from covid, GDPR, cannabis legalization</li>
                        <li>- Belief: work from home adoption, climate change awareness, crypotcurrency as a financial asset</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Use Cases: how will the user segment use your product to achieve their goal? </h3>
                <p>Consider the use cases. How will your user segment use your product to achieve their goal? For example:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Gym-Goer Gabe can discover new, simple recipes limited to the ingredients in his kitchen on our product to eat healthy meals each day.</li>
                        <li>- Gym-Goer Gabe can access nutrient breakdowns of each recipe on our product to eat health meals and build muscle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Brainstorm Ideas: how might we solve these problems?</h3>
                <p>Work with your team to surface ideas for what to build next. Start by asking this question: “Using the information we know, <i>how might we {solve this problem}</i>?”</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- How might we provide access to beginner-friendly meals?</li>
                        <li>- How might we provide access to quick meals?</li>
                        <li>- How might we provide access to meals that align with user goals?</li>
                        <li>- [Bonus] How might we solve these problems in a <i>never-before-seen</i> way?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>List out all of the brainstorm ideas for each problem. For example, to provide access to meals that align with user goals:</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- LLM-Powered Meal Alignment Tool: input fitness goals and dietary preferences, generate personalized meal plans with nutrient breakdowns.</li>
                        <li>- Goal-Driven Meal Tags: tag recipes on our platform (e.g: high protein, low fat, calorie dense).</li>
                        <li>- Dynamic Meal Generator: create recipes tailored to specific goals using available ingredients.</li>
                        <li>- AI-Powered Meal Substitutions: suggest healthy substitutions to make favorite meals align with fitness goals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Validate Ideas: can we build this?</h3>
                <p>Validate your <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">assumptions</a> on if the proposed idea is feasible and viable.</p>
                <h3>Prioritize Ideas: which ideas are most impactful?</h3>
