                <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                    <p>Let's walkthrough building a product strategy from surfacing problems to taking actions that solve them.</p>




                    <h2>1) Define the Core Problem</h2>
                    <p>If you were to walk up to someone on the street and ask them which problem they were having, what would they say to you? <i>This</i> is the type of problem statement we want to define. Perhaps something is inaccessible, too expensive, or it takes too much time or too many steps to complete a task. Every product you work on is going to help somebody solve some problem in order to achieve some goal. How would you write out that problem?</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples of core problem statements you might hear if you're focused on <b>acquiring new users</b>:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It's hard for me to access a doctor</li>
                            <li>- I can't eat a healthy meal each day</li>
                            <li>- I'm unable to remember all of my passwords</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Here are some core problem statements you might hear if you're focused on <b>optimizing for existing users</b>:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It takes too long to complete my task</li>
                            <li>- I don't understand how to use this</li>
                            <li>- I can't find what I'm looking for</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Root Problems: what's <i>really</i> going on here?</h3>
                    <p>Let's focus on a single core problem statement: "I can't eat a healthy meal each day." While this may be what someone on the street tells you when you ask them what problem they're having, there are usually underlying reasons that can you give you more context about the <i>true</i> problems they're experiencing. You can get a better understanding of the underlying problems by asking "Why?"</p>
                    <p>For example if you asked "why can't you eat a healthy meal each day?" then you might get the following answers:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I think cooking takes too long</li>
                            <li>- I don't know how to cook</li>
                            <li>- I don't know which meals I should eat</li>
                            <li>- I'm too busy most evenings to cook</li>
                            <li>- I'm too tired at the end of the day to cook</li>
                            <li>- I don't enjoy cooking</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>A common technique for learning the underlying problems someone may be facing that leads to their core problem statement is to continue asking "Why?" until you get to the root cause.</p>
                    <h3>Gather Evidence</h3>
                    <p>Be sure to gather <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">evidence</a> that validates your assumptions regarding whether or not a problem is real. Your strategy starts with a deep understanding of which problems you want to (and which you can) solve. Once you've identified a core problem you want to solve, you can then dive into understanding who is affected by it.</p>
                    




                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>2) Define the Target Customer</h2>
                    <p>It may sound counterintuitive, but you are going to want to choose a <i>narrow</i> user segment to target. I think of this as a "small pond" approach: you will want to focus on a small pond, acquiring the smaller fish (early market) within that pond so that you can eventually work your way up to catching its bigger fish (mainstream market). Your smaller fish are going to be less risk averse, seeking out new solutions and strategic leaps forward to accomplish their goals. Your bigger fish are going to be more risk averse, looking for incremental improvements towards accomplising their goals; they'll learn about you through word of mouth. Let's work our way to a narrow customer segment:</p>
                    <h3>Understand the Customer Types: who is buying my product?</h3>
                    <p>Understand what type of customer you're targeting and selling to. You're going to need to spend a lot of time with them, whether you like it or not. These are the fish in the pond that will spread the word about your product amongst themselves (that is, if you can solve their problem) so that eventually the big fish in the pond start to become aware of what you have to offer.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Consumers (Hobbyists, Students): make low cost purchase decisions for their specific use cases.</li>
                            <li>- Individual Contributors (Engineers, Designers): doesn't make purchase decisions, but they'll be able to get you a seat at the purchasing table for specific use cases.</li>
                            <li>- Department Managers: make medium cost purchase decisions for specific use cases that can be adobted within their organization.</li>
                            <li>- Enterprise Executives: make large cost purchase decisions for use cases that can be adopted broadly throughout their company.</li>
                            <li>- SMB Owners: make low cost purchase decisions for use cases that return significant value.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Goal of the Target Customer: what are they trying to do?</h3>
                    <p>At this point you have an understanding of the problem you want to solve, which will coincide with the goal your target customer is trying to achieve:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>If their core problem is "I can't eat a healthy meal each day" then flip that problem around to understand their goal: "I want to eat a healthy meal each day"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand the Context of the Target Customer Situation: what's <i>really</i> going on in their life?</h3>
                    <p>You understand what type of customer you're targeting and what goal your customer has, but why does your customer want to achieve this goal? What is going on in their life? What situation are they in that drives them to want to do this? Here are some examples for why a user may want to achieve the goal of eating a health meal each day:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Receiving a health diagnosis</li>
                            <li>- Starting a workout routine</li>
                            <li>- Aligning with sustainability goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand their Hiring Criteria: what does your target customer require in a product that they'll use?</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then how could your product be substantially better than the market substitute? By understanding the context of your target customers' situation you can also understand their hiring criteria.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I want a product that makes meal preparation quick</li>
                            <li>- I want a product that is beginner-friendly</li>
                            <li>- I want a product that is tailored to my fitness goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Understand their Firing Criteria: why would your target customer leave a product that they use today?</h3>
                    <p>If your target user is using a market substitute to achieve their goal today then what problems would trigger them to switch from a market substitute to a new product? By understanding the context of your target customers' situation you can also understand their firing criteria.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- It takes too long to make a healthy meal</li>
                            <li>- I don't understand the instructions</li>
                            <li>- The meals I find are not fitness-oriented</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Create a Persona</h3>
                    <p>Now that we have a clearer picture of who we're targeting, let's create a persona. Here is an example of a simple persona for our target customers' goal and context:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <i>Time-Crunched Tina (age: 25-34) is a busy professional starting a workout routine who needs a quick, beginner-friendly way to prepare meals tailored to her fitness goals in order to eat healthy every day and stay on track with her lifestyle changes.</i>
                        </ul>
                    </div>


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>3) Define Market Substitutes</h2>
                    <p>If your target user has a goal of eating a healthy meal each day then how can they achieve their goal in the market right now? Your competition isn't who is doing <i>what you're doing</i>, it's who offers a solution to your target users' problem. Here are some examples of market substitutes for Time-Crunched Tina:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Whole Foods: pick up a pre-made meal</li>
                                <li>- Favor: have a pre-made meal delivered</li>
                                <li>- HelloFresh: have ingredients delivered with simple recipes</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>4) Business Goal</h2>
                    <h3>Define the Output Metrics</h3>
                    <p>Similar to how your target customer has a problem they want to solve, your business has a problem that they want to solve too. What is your business goal? Is it to increase signups or to reduce churn? Ultimately, all roads lead to revenue. The business goals are going to be the output metrics that your strategy is going to be focused on pushing.</p>
                    
                    


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>5) Identify 3-5 Root Problems to Solve</h2>
                    <p>By now you have an understanding of the problems your target customer is experiencing and the goals of your business. Out of all the problems you've listed that your target customer is experiencing, which of those problems make it hard for your business to achieve its goal? These are the problems you'll want to solve.</p>
                    <p>Out of the problems we discovered previously, let's focus on these problems:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I think cooking takes too long</li>
                            <li>- I don't know how to cook</li>
                            <li>- I don't know which meals I should eat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    
                    


                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>6) Vision</h2>
                    <p>Let's keep moving down the list! You know the problems you want to solve, and the context around the target customer you're going to solve it for. You know their hiring and firing criteria. Now you need to know: what does the world look like after these these problems are solved? Create a product vision by painting a picture of what destination you're going to reach so that your team knows where you're headed.</p>
                    <p>I recommend the following guidelines when writing out your product vision: keep your vision focused on the problem you're solving, focus on the value your customer is going to receive, think BIG (while being realistic), and take a leap of faith. Here's an example:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- A future where preparing the healthy meal you need will feel as effortless and natural as making a cup of coffee.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>



                    <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                    <h2>7) Focus & Actions</h2>
                    <p>Now that we know where we're headed, how are we going to get there? How are we going to beat the competition?</p>
                    <h3>Reaching Product Market Fit: what stage of PMF is your product in?</h3>
                    <p>Before you start deciding what you're going to build, it's important to understand where you should focus your effort, and much of this depends on whether you've reached Product Market Fit or not:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If you are Pre-PMF then focus on efforts that are going to boost your counter-position against the competition (until you've reached PMF).</li>
                            <li>- If you've reached PMF then focus your efforts on building network effects, increasing switching costs, or creating scale economies.</li>
                            <li>- If you've maintained PMF for a long time then focus your efforts on your branding, your cornered resource, or your process power.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Let's assume you're working on a strategy for a meal planning app that has recently reached PMF for the remained of this exercise with the following use cases:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Time-Crunched Tina can discover healthy recipes on our mobile app in order to eat healthy meals each day.</li>
                            <li>- Time-Crunched Tina can access shopping lists for healthy recipes on our mobile app in order to eat healthy meals each day.</li>
                            <li>- Time-Crunched Tina can read healthy recipes on our mobile app in order to eat healthy meals each day.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Focusing on the "Aha!" Moment: the action that results in achieving your business goals</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes referred to as the North Star metric. This is the core action that, when increased, will result in you achieving your business goal. This core action being completed by a user represents that the user has received the value that your product has to offer, and therefore is more likely to keep coming back. Users that complete these actions are engaged with your product; this is the action you want a user to complete during their first time using your product. It's important to choose an action that represents value, but also results in creating network effects and/or increasing switching costs. For example:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Saving a recipe to their library</li>
                            <li>- Marking ingredients as "bought" in a recipe checklist</li>
                            <li>- Checking off a recipe as "cooked"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Taking Action: what are we going to build?</h3>
                    <p>Now that we know what we're focused on and what we want the user to accomplish, it's time to define the actions we're going to take next (sometimes referred to as initiatives). What you build can be found at the intersection between <b>customer-centric actions</b> (solving user problems) and <b>technology-led actions</b> (with your tech stack).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Use Inflections: what new thing has been introduced?</h3>
                    <p>What "new thing" has been introduced to the world and how can it be used to empower your product? Inflections can come from technological advances, regulatory changes, or shifts in your target customer beliefs. These are waves of change happening in an industry or a population. Some examples of these can be found below:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Technology Inflections: access to LLMs, smartphones, cloud computing</li>
                            <li>- Regulation Inflections: telemedicine laws from covid, GDPR, cannabis legalization</li>
                            <li>- Belief Inflections: adoption of work from home, climate change awareness, crypotcurrency as a financial asset</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Brainstorm Ideas: how might we solve these problems?</h3>
                    <p>You know which problems you're solving, you know the technology you can use to solve them, and there may be an inflection available to use to your advantage. Now it is finally time to bring it all together and brainstorm what you're going to build next so that you can arrive at your vision in the future. Start by asking this question: <i>How might we {solve this problem}?</i></p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- How might we reduce the time it takes for our users to cook a healthy meal?</li>
                            <li>- How might we teach our users how to cook a healthy meal?</li>
                            <li>- How might we guide our users so that they choose the right healthy meal for their fitness goals?</li>
                            <li>- [Bonus] How might we solve these problems in a never-before-seen way?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>As a result of this brainstorm session you may get a long list of ideas, such as:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Use LLMs to suggest quick and healthy recipes based on the ingredients in the users' pantries.</li>
                            <li>- Create a voice-activated cooking assistant that gives hands-free step-by-step guidance to reduce the time users spend needing to see the instructions.</li>
                            <li>- Use LLMs to analyze users' fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain) and suggest healthy meal plans and recipes that align with their unique nutritional needs.</li>
                            <li>- Create an entry form where users can add their fitness goals, and have an LLM generate a variety of recipes throughout the week that are optimized for their fitness needs.</li>
                            <li>- Use LLMs to simplify complex recipes, making them easier to cook with fewer ingredients, while not compromising nutrition.</li>
                            <li>- Use LLMs to generate recipes based on a user's preferences, health goals, and available ingredients.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>And again, be sure to validate <a href="/posts/assumption-validation.html">assumptions</a> regarding whether or not what is being proposed is feasible and viable.</p>
                    <h3>Prioritization: which of these ideas should we work on first?</h3>
                    <p>You know the problems, you know the context, you know the hiring and firing criteria, the business goals, the actions you want to drive, and the destination you want to reach. Which of the ideas during your brainstorm session are going to solve those problems for your specific customer context, while also making a positive impact on your business and helping you reach your product vision? There are many ways to prioritize, including understanding information such as how many daily active users (DAU) would this reach, and what is the effort needed to build the solution? What is important is that you prioritize the projects that are going to be the most impactful to your users and to your business.</p>

                    <h2>8) Evangelize the Strategy</h2>
                    <p>This document is an example of how someone might approach creating a product strategy, but one important aspect to remember is that you should be communicating and getting feedback from your peers throughout this whole process. By the end of your strategy there should be alignment and understanding on which problems are being solved, and on which actions are being taken. Evanglize your product strategy, communicate with your partners, and get the alignment you need so that you, your team, and your product are set up for success!</p>
