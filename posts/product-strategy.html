                    <p>Define your product strategy by answering the following questions:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- What is your business trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- What are your target customers trying to achieve?</li>
                            <li>- What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</li>
                            <li>- Can your target customer achieve their goal using your product?</li>
                            <li>- What value does your product provide?</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What is your business trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Your business goals are the metrics your business is trying to impact:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Increase sign-ups</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Who are your target customers and what are they trying to achieve?</h2>
                    <p>Who are your target customers? Who are the users that would be very disappointed if they could no longer use your product? These are the customers that consider your product a must-have. Your target customers will be important for identifying how you should position your product.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- 25-35 year old (mid-career) Jobseeker in the Tech Industry</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers trying to do? This is sometimes referred to as their job to be done:</p>
                        <div class="example-content-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Get a job</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    <p>What are your target customers' common use cases? How would your target customers use your product to achieve their goal? These are all possible routes that your users go down to achieve their job to be done:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Search for a specific job title</li>
                            <li>- Search for a specific company</li>
                            <li>- Search for a specific skill set</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>Measure a core action that represents your target customers achieving their goal (the “aha” moment). Increasing this core action should correlate to increasing your business metrics.</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- When a job application is submitted</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Can your target customer achieve their goal using your product?</h2>
                    <p>If yes then which goals can your target customers achieve using your product? You can reduce the time it takes on your product to reach this value:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Get a job</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>If no then which goals can your target customers not achieve using your product? You can add new value to your product by offering a way to achieve these goals:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Research a company</li>
                            <li>- Research salaries</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What market offerings exist that your target customers use to achieve their goal?</h2>
                    <p>What marketing offerings do your users compare your product to when trying to achieve their goal?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Indeed</li>
                            <li>- LinkedIn</li>
                            <li>- Glassdoor</li>
                            <li>- ZipRecruiter</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave the market offering they currently use? Your target customers might leave the market offering they use today if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <p>Why would your target customers leave your product for a different market offering? Your target customers might leave your product if another offering provides more value.</p>
                    <h2>What is your guiding policy?</h2>
                    <p>What stage of Product Market Fit (PMF) are you in?</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- If pre-PMF then focus on exploiting your counter-position</li>
                            <li>- If post-PMF then focus on exploiting scale economies, network economies, or switching costs</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What problems exist and what hypotheses do you have?</h2>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- I can't find a job that when searching for a skill set because the search results are not relevant to me</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Which actions should you take next?</h2>
                    <p>Maintain a list of actions that you can take to help your target customers achieve their goal and to help your business achieve its goal. Actions are not roadmap items. Actions represent initiatives. Multiple roadmap items can fall under a single initiative. Your actions will likely fall within one of the categories below:</p>
                    <div class="example-content-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Add new value by building a way for your target customers to achieve their goal using your product; increase user acquisition</li>
                            <li>- Reduce time to established value by removing friction in the user task flow leading up to the core action representing the “aha” moment (double down on your existing value); increase user retention</li>
                            <li>- Scale established value if justified by ROI; increase user acquisition and retention</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Categorize the list by whether or not an action can exploit an advantage. Rerank the list by which actions are estimated to have the most impact on your business goals if worked on. Now that you have a list of prioritized actions to work on next it's time to start the <a href="/posts/product-development-lifecycle.html">product development lifecycle</a>.</p>
