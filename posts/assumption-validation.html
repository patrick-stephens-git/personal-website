                <h1>Assumption Validation</h1>
                <p>Every assumption made when building products is a risk. Validate assumptions to build valuable products that solve real problems.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Gathering Evidence: is this problem real?</h2>
                <p>Gain a deep understanding of the problem your customers experience before building a solution.</p>
                <h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
                <p>Anecdotal evidence signals a problem might exist. This evidence is helpful because it's used to surface real problems, but it's not the truth, you're still making assumptions. Use anecdotal evidence to guide your investigation, avoid using anecdotal evidence to build a product.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Feedback:</b> What does your target user <i>say</i>? Talk with your target users, set up user interviews or employee dogfooding, review NPS, customer reviews, customer support tickets, forums, or set up qualitative surveys.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Observation:</b> How do your users try to achieve their goal? Observe your target users, understand their tasks, or workarounds they attempt.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Competitive Analysis:</b> Does a solution already exist? Understanding how the market solves (or attempts to solve) this problem. Benchmark yourself against your competitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Clear Evidence</h3>
                <p>Clear evidence shows a real problem exists. It's okay not having this at the start, set up a research plan and, if needed, get support from a designer, user researcher, or an engineer to gather it.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Data Analysis:</b> What happens? Explore analytics for drop-off points or low engagement for user cohorts. Watch server logs for errors, low performance, or irregular patterns.</li>
                        <li>- <b>True Events:</b> What do your target users <i>do</i>? Set up demand tests or usability tests, utilize quantitative surveys, observe screen recordings for friction points, or activate A/B tests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Value Validation</h2>
                <p>Solving problems creates value. After surfacing a real problem, how do you know if your solution creates value? Find out using these methodologies:</p>
                <h3>No Prototype</h3>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Fake Door Test:</b> A link taking users to a landing page, notifying them you are working on solving this problem. Measure link clicks to validate interest. Use this page to recruit users for interviews, or testing prototypes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Design-Only Prototype</h3>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Usability+Value Test:</b> After usability testing, does the product solve the interviewee's problem? Do they ask to sign up or pay? Do they ask if they can use the product now? If you want to build with an active user, would they partner with you to use the product and provide feedback? If your product is available, will the interviewee share it online?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Live-Data Prototype</h3>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>A/B Test:</b> Test a new experience with 1% or 50% of users. Measure impact to users reaching the “Aha!” moment to understand if value has been reached. You do not need production-ready code.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Invite-Only Test:</b> If you lack the users to measure statistical significance of A/B testing, then invite a limited set of users for prototype testing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Hybrid Prototype</h3>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Wizard of Oz Test:</b> Show an interviewee a design prototype. Manually “pull the strings” behind the curtain so it appears to function as if a production-ready product.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Usability Validation</h2>
                <p>Users need to know how to use your product. Show an interviewee a design prototype, can they use it to solve their problem? Does friction appear while using the prototype? End this interview with a value test.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Feasibility Validation</h2>
                <p>Your team needs to be able to build the product and you have deadlines. Discuss the project with your engineers, can they build it with their skillset? How much effort do they estimate it will take?</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Viability Validation</h2>
                <p>Your product needs to be viable for the business. Walk through the problem and solution with your stakeholders. Address viability concerns from sales, finance, legal, security, marketing, or other teams working with you.</p>
