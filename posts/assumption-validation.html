                <h1>Assumption Validation</h1>
                <p>Resources are expensive. They should focus on creating valuable, usable, feasible, and viable solutions for real problems. You should have a hypothesis before you've dedicated resources to solving a problem. Validate the assumptions you've made with your hypothesis by gathering evidence that increases the likelihood of your hypothesis being true.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Gathering Evidence</h2>
                <p>Gather evidence to increase your confidence in whether a problem truly exists and whether or not you are solving that problem.</p>
                <h3>Anecdotal Evidence</h3>
                <p>Anecdotal evidence gives you signals that certain problems might exist. This type of evidence is helpful, but it's not the truth. By using this evidence you are still making assumptions that need validation. You will want clear evidence before dedicating resources to build a solution, but anecdotal evidence is a great signal that can be used to point you in the right direction to gather the clear evidence you'll need.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Feedback:</b> What do your users tell you about your product? Some methods for gathering this evidence include NPS, reviews, customer support tickets, online forums, user interviews, surveys, dogfooding feedback, and much more.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Competitive Analysis:</b> Do your competitors solve this problem?</li>
                        <li>- <b>Industry Research:</b> What's happening in your industry?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Clear Evidence</h3>
                <p>Clear evidence gives you real signals that a problem exists or that you're building a solution that solves a real problem. This type of evidence represents the truth. It's okay to not have this evidence at the start. You may need to set up a research plan to gather this type of evidence. You might need support from a designer, a user researcher, or an engineer to gather it.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Data Analysis:</b> What does the quantitative data show? Some methods for gathering this evidence include DAU estimates (is this a large enough problem?), funnel analysis or clickstream data (where do users drop-off?), engagement data (are users not reaching the "Aha! moment"?), heatmaps, and much more.</li>
                        <li>- <b>True Events:</b> What do your users actually do? What actions do your users truly take? Some methods for learning this include dogfooding actions, video recordings of user sessions, usability testing, demand testing, and much more (consider the examples listed under Value Validation and Usability Testing listed below).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Value Validation</h2>
                <p>Your product strategy will result in a list of ideas of what to build next. How confident are you in whether or not this idea is actually valuable? You as the product manager are the owner of validating value. You can start working with your design and engineer partners to validate value with demand tests or prototypes to increase your confidence.</p>
                <h3>No Prototype</h3>
                <p>Gather evidence showing if your target customers have interest in your solution.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Fake Door (Landing Page) Test:</b> A link that does not take the user to a solution, but instead takes the user to a landing page that notifies the user that you are doing research about this problem. Use this page to recruit customers to interview about solving this problem. You can use this to recruit customers if you are going to do an invite-only test for a proposed solution. You can use click data as a measurement of interest.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Design Prototype</h3>
                <p>Gather evidence showing if your solution is valuable to your target customers.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Value Test:</b> Start by completing a usability test with your target customer. Does the solution solve their problem? Do they ask if they will be able to access the solution soon? Are they ready to purchase the solution today? Would they spend their time partnering with you to continue testing the solution as you continue building it? Would they share this product on their social media now?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Engineering Prototype</h3>
                <p>Gather evidence showing how your target customers perceive your solution.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Side-by-Side Test:</b> Show 1 target customer 2 variations of the output you provide, have employees dogfood each variant, gathering human judgements offline, or complete your own manual ratings: does your new solution improve the output quality compared to an existing solution?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Hybrid Prototype</h3>
                <p>Gather evidence showing if your target customers have interest in your solution. Gather evidence if your solution is valuable to your target customers.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>Wizard of Oz Test:</b> Apply the frontend experience to a small set of a population. Use a human or a manually curated database to pull the strings behind the scenes. Use this test to collect success signals from a limited amount of users. Does the solution solve the user problem?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Live Data Prototype</h3>
                <p>Gather evidence showing if your solution is valuable to your target customers.</p>
                <div class="example-content-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>- <b>A/B Test:</b> Apply the new experience to a percentage of users (99%/1%) or (50%/50%). Use this test to collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing with users does not need to be production-ready code.</li>
                        <li>- <b>Invite-Only Test:</b> Use when you don't have enough users to reach statistical significance with an A/B Test. Recruit users that will use your prototype. Collect success signals from a limited number of users. The prototype you are testing does not need to be production-ready code.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Usability Validation</h2>
                <p>When the user experiences the problem are they aware of the solution? Is the user aware of how to solve their problem using the solution? Does the user run into friction when attempting to complete the task? At this point you are working with your designer on a design prototype. Test this prototype with your users or target customers.</p>
                <p>Your design partner is the owner of validating usability.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Feasibility Validation</h2>
                <p>Can your business build the solution? How much effort would it take to build the solution? Validate feasibility as you and your engineering team walk-through the solution together.</p>
                <p>Your engineer partner is the owner of validating feasibility.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Viability Validation</h2>
                <p>Connect with your stakeholders and walk them through the problem and the solution. Let them bring up any viability concerns about your product. Validate those concerns. Stakeholder viability concerns might come from sales, finance, legal, security, marketing, or other teams that you work with.</p>
                <p>You as the product manager are the owner of validating viability.</p>
