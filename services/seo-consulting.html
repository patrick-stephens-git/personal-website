                <h1>SEO Strategy Not Working? Let Me Help</h1>
                <p>Traditional SEO education treats search engines like black boxes. You learn to optimize for algorithms you've never seen, submit sitemaps to systems you don't understand, and chase ranking factors without grasping how search systems actually process, retrieve, and rank content for queries. <b>But did you know that you don't need to be a Search Engineer to understand how search works?</b></p>
                <p>With <span id="seo-years-experience"></span> years experience in SEO and <span id="internal-search-years-experience"></span> years building internal search products, working with industry-leading SaaS companies, I am uniquely positioned to provide your team with insights into the systems behind SEO so they can create impactful growth strategies. <a href="mailto:patrickcstephens@me.com?subject=Intro%20call%20for%20SEO%20Consulting%20Services%20patrickcstephens.com">Let's talk</a> about how I can help your SEO team.</p>

                <h2>Traditional SEO Educations Tells You <i>What</i> to Do, Not <i>Why</i> to Do It</h2>
                <p>For SEO Teams dissatisfied with the black box narrative of search engines, <b>I offer your team insights into how search engines work</b>. Unlike articles, conferences, or influencers that tell you to change your title tags and headers to match target keywords, I explain to your team <i>how</i> search engines process queries and <i>why</i> changing your title tags and headers might or might not be effective.</p>
                <h2>SEO Consulting Services:</h2>
                <h3>"How Search Works" Training Session</h3>
                <p>Teaching your SEO Team how search works will result in winning SEO growth strategies, leading to SEO traffic increasing for your brand.</p>
                <p>My comprehensive training session breaks down search engine systems. You'll learn about techniques search engines use to understand website and query text (including, but not limited to, using LLMs), how search engines build domain awareness (Query Understanding, Document Understanding, and Knowledge Graphs), and how they personalize results for users. You'll also learn about retrieval techniques (Text-Based, Embedding-Based, and Hybrid Search), how search engines rank documents, and how search teams validate the quality of those rankings.</p>
                <p>By the end of this training, <b>your SEO team will think about solving SEO problems like a Search Engineer thinks about solving search problems.</b></p>
                <h3>Ongoing & Adhoc SEO Support</h3>
                <p>Are you looking for ongoing or adhoc SEO support? I can help with overflow SEO requests, whether that be creating a winning SEO strategy for your team to implement, completing an SEO audit from the perspective of someone who has built internal search systems, building a keyword research report, and more.</p>
                <div class="main-content-divider"></div>
                <h2>Ready for Your SEO Team to Think Like Search Engineers?</h2>
                <p>The difference between tactical SEO and strategic SEO is systems knowledge. When your SEO team understands how search engines process, index, and rank content, they make better decisions about where to focus their SEO efforts.</p>
