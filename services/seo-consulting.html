                <h1>SEO Strategy Not Working? Let Me Help</h1>
                <p>Traditional SEO education treats search engines like black boxes. You learn to optimize for algorithms you've never seen, submit sitemaps to systems you don't understand, and chase ranking factors without grasping how search systems actually process, retrieve, and rank content for queries. But did you know that <b>you don't need to be a Search Engineer to understand how search works?</b></p>
                <p>With <span id="career-years-experience"></span> years experience in SEO and <span id="product-years-experience"></span> years building internal search products, working with industry-leading SaaS companies, I am uniquely positioned to provide your team with insights into the systems behind SEO so they can create impactful growth strategies. <a href="mailto:patrickcstephens@me.com?subject=Intro%20call%20for%20SEO%20Consulting%20Services%20patrickcstephens.com">Let's talk</a> today about how I can help your SEO team.</p>

                <h2>Traditional SEO Educations Tells You the What to Do, Not the Why to Do It</h2>
                <p>For SEO Teams who are dissatisfied with the black box narrative of search engines, I offer a service that provides your team with insights into how search engines work. Unlike articles or talks that tell you to change your title tags and headers to match your target keywords, I explain to your team how search engines process keywords and why changing your title tags and headers may or may not be effective.</p>
                <h2>My Core Training Services</h2>
                <h3>"How Search Works" Training Session</h3>
                <p>I believe that teaching your SEO Team how search works will result in your team creating winning SEO growth strategies, which will lead to increased SEO traffic for your brand.</p>
                <p>This comprehensive session breaks down search engine architectures. You'll learn about techniques search engines use to understand text (including, but not limited to using LLMs), how search engines build domain awareness (Query Understanding, Document Understanding, and Knowledge Graphs), how they personalize results for users, you'll learn about retrieval techniques (Text-Based, Embedding-Based, and Hybrid) and how search engines rank documents and how search teams validate the quality of those rankings.</p>
                <p>By the end of this training, your team will think about solving SEO problems like a Search Engineer thinks about solving search problems.</p>
                <h3>Ongoing & Adhoc SEO Support</h3>
                <p>Are you looking for ongoing or adhoc SEO support? I can help with SEO requests, whether that be creating a winning SEO strategy for your team to implement or completing an SEO audit from the perspective of someone who has built internal search systems.</p>

                <h2>Ready to Master SEO Strategy?</h2>
                <p>The difference between tactical SEO and strategic SEO is systems knowledge. When you understand how search engines process, index, and rank content, you make better decisions about where to focus your optimization efforts.</p>
